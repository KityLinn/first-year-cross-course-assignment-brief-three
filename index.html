  <h1>Hello world!</h1>
  <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
  <h2>Web Security</h2>
  <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security
    attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
  <p id="web-security-answer">I would advice the client to sanitize their data using a well known third party software
    such as the sanitize-html package in NodeJS. Using a secure autherizer and authenticator such as OneLogin. To apply
    Continuous Deployment/Continuous Integration to run checks on the code before it is delivered to production. Advice
    them to implement an automatic user timeout, to protect any user who leaves their credential open when leaving the
    computer. That a network engineer would be best suited in matters of network security. I would stress getting everyone
    on the team informed about security best practises. Anyone working within a network could potentially compromise the
    website unknowingly. Advice them to start scanning for voulnerabilities early on in development, this makes code much
    easier to fix and security holes easier to plug as it's fresh in development. It can also be good to perform security
    exercises. Mock attacks to check for voulnerabilities. </p>
