  <h1>Hello world!</h1>
  <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
  <h2>Web Security</h2>
  <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security
    attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
  <p id="web-security-answer">I would advice the client to sanitize their data using a well known third party software
    such as the sanitize-html package in NodeJS. Using a secure autherizer and authenticator such as OneLogin. To apply
    Continuous Deployment/Continuous Integration to run checks on the code before it is delivered to production. Advice
    them to implement an automatic user timeout. That a network engineer would be best suited in matters of network security.</p>
